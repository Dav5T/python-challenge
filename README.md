**Reading CSV File:**
Make sure that the csv files are sitting in, "Resources", folder respectively. 
    1. Python-Challenge\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv
    2. Python-Challege\PyPoll\Resources\election_data.csv

When running the code, make sure your terminal open to the Resource directory

**Creating Text File:**
Make sure that you have a folder called, Analysis. This is where you will be able to find the text files of the final analysis after you run the codes 
    1. Python-Challenge\PyBank\Analysis
    2. Python-Challege\PyPoll\Analysis

**Sources**

*PyPoll*
Source 1 and 2 were crucial for this assignment. I was aware of the count function in python. However, I could not get it to work with the data from the csv file. After researching, I found the solution from source 1, StackOverflow. It took me a while to get it to work as I had to do further reading. Eventually with the help of source 2, I was able to get everything to work.
